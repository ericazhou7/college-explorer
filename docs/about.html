  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    In the last few years, the college application process has become increasingly focused on competitive admission
    to elite schools with widespread brand recognition, where high income families have a distinct advantage. Highlighting
    schools based on opportunity for economic mobility, especially for low income families, is an under-served use case with
    existing college exploration and ranking tools. In this paper, we present College Mobility Explorer, an interface to
    inform students of college options based on institutional characteristics and student desires, while prioritizing economic
    success post-graduation as an outcome. The interface allows students to select target values for different features of
    schools and weight how desirable those features are. The College Mobility Explorer then calculates a match score for each
    potential school based on user customization and displays a ranked list of colleges that most closely align with student
    desires. The College Mobility Explorer also displays a scatter plot of all potential schools based on both match score and
    mobility score, a measure of projected post-graduate economic rank for users. Thus, the platform allows for both the discovery
    of individual schools for students to make more informed application decisions and the depiction of overall trends of
    post-graduate mobility based on several different features of colleges.
